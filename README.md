# LLM-powered RAG System using Groq API and Langchain

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** via the **Groq API**. It enhances text generation by retrieving relevant context from an external knowledge base before generating responses, improving accuracy and relevance.

## Key Features
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Groq API for natural language understanding and text generation.
- **RAG Mechanism**: Retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base to enhance model responses.
- **Efficient Query Processing**: Optimized retrieval pipeline for handling queries with contextual augmentation.
- **API-driven Architecture**: Uses Groq API for fast and scalable inference.
- **No Frontend Required**: Fully backend-based implementation focusing on efficiency and deployment.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your Groq API key:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. **User Query** → Input is taken from the user.
2. **Retrieval Component** → Fetches relevant documents for context.
3. **Augmentation** → Combines user query with retrieved knowledge.
4. **LLM Processing** → Groq API generates a response based on the augmented input.
5. **Output** → The final response is returned to the user.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **Groq API** (LLM for text generation)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** (For enhanced responses)
- **LangChain / FAISS / ChromaDB** (Optional retrieval libraries if used)

## Future Enhancements
- Improve retrieval accuracy using advanced embeddings.
- Deploy as an API service for easy integration.
- Extend support for multiple LLM providers.
